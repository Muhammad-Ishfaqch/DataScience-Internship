# Final Report: Loan Prediction Analysis using CRISP-DM Framework

## 1. Business Understanding
### Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan based on various demographic and financial features. This information is crucial for the bank to tailor its marketing strategies effectively.

### Problem Statement
The bank has observed a significant number of customers who declined the loan offers. Understanding the factors influencing this decision can help improve future offerings and marketing efforts.

## 2. Data Understanding
### Data Collection
The dataset consists of a CSV file named `bankloan.csv`, which includes 5000 customer records with 14 attributes related to demographics, financial status, and loan acceptance.

### Dataset Overview
The key attributes include:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Experience**: Work experience in years (may contain negative values).
- **Income**: Annual income (in thousands).
- **Family**: Number of family members.
- **CCAvg**: Average monthly credit card spending (in thousands).
- **Education**: Education level (1: Bachelor's, 2: Master's, 3: Professional).
- **Mortgage**: Home mortgage value (in thousands).
- **Personal.Loan**: Target variable indicating if the customer accepted the loan.

### Data Exploration
Initial exploration revealed no missing values but identified outliers in the `Income`, `CCAvg`, and `Mortgage` columns. The `Experience` column contained negative values, indicating data entry errors.

## 3. Data Preparation
### Data Cleaning
- **Negative Experience Values**: Converted to absolute values.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Identified and analyzed outliers in `Income`, `CCAvg`, and `Mortgage`.

### Feature Selection
Columns deemed unnecessary for prediction (such as `ID` and `ZIP.Code`) were removed. The remaining features were retained for modeling.

## 4. Modeling
### Model Selection
Several algorithms were considered, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

### Model Training
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and models were trained to predict the likelihood of loan acceptance.

### Model Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Logistic Regression yielded promising results.

## 5. Evaluation
### Results Interpretation
- **Key Influencers**: Income and average credit card spending showed moderate positive correlations with loan acceptance.
- **Weak Influencers**: Education level and family size had negligible correlations.

### Recommendations
- Enhance marketing strategies for customers with lower incomes and spending habits.
- Promote features of personal loans to attract potential customers.

## 6. Deployment
### Implementation Strategy
Based on the findings, the bank should implement targeted marketing campaigns focusing on high-potential customer segments identified through the analysis.

### Future Work
- Further investigation into customer feedback and preferences to refine loan offerings.
- Continuous monitoring of model performance and periodic updates based on new data.

## Conclusion
This analysis, structured through the CRISP-DM framework, provides actionable insights for the bank to enhance its personal loan offerings and improve customer engagement. The study highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in banking.
