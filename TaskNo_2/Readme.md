# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview
This project applies the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to analyze a loan approval dataset. It aims to identify key factors affecting loan approval decisions and build a predictive model for classifying loan applications.

## Business Understanding
### Objective
To analyze factors influencing loan approvals and develop a predictive model to assist in decision-making.

### Goals
- Identify features that significantly impact loan approval.
- Create a model that predicts loan status (Approved/Rejected).

## Data Understanding
### Data Source
The dataset is contained in `loan_approval_dataset.csv`, which includes 4269 records with 13 attributes.

### Key Features
- **loan_id**: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- **no_of_dependents**: Number of dependents of the applicant.
- **education**: Education level.
- **self_employed**: Employment status.
- **income_annum**: Annual income.
- **loan_amount**: Amount of loan applied for.
- **loan_status**: Status of the loan (Approved/Rejected).

### Initial Exploration
- The dataset contains no missing values.
- Summary statistics provide insights into feature distributions.

## Data Preparation
### Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary whitespace from column names.
- Encoded categorical variables for analysis.

### Feature Engineering
- Considered transformations and interactions among features to improve model performance.

## Modeling
### Model Selection
- Selected Logistic Regression for its effectiveness in binary classification.

### Training
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained the model using the training data.

## Evaluation
### Model Performance
- Evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Findings indicate significant factors influencing loan approval (e.g., income and education).

## Deployment
### Recommendations
- Implement the predictive model in loan processing systems.
- Regularly update the model with new data for accuracy.

### Future Work
- Explore additional features, such as credit scores.
- Investigate ensemble methods for potential performance improvements.
