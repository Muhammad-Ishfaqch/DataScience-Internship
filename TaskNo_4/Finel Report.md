# Final Report: Insurance Dataset Analysis

## 1. Business Understanding
The objective of this analysis is to understand the factors affecting insurance charges incurred by individuals. This insight can help insurance companies tailor their policies and pricing strategies based on customer demographics and health metrics.

## 2. Data Understanding
The dataset consists of 1,338 records with 7 attributes:
- **age**: Age of the insured individual.
- **sex**: Gender of the insured (male/female).
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index.
- **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- **smoker**: Indicates if the insured is a smoker (yes/no).
- **region**: Geographic region of the insured.
- **charges**: Insurance charges incurred by the individual.

Initial data exploration revealed no missing values and one duplicate record. Statistical summaries provided insights into the distribution of numerical variables.

## 3. Data Preparation
Data preparation steps included:
- Dropping the duplicate record.
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., sex, smoker, region) for subsequent analysis.
- Normalizing numerical features if necessary, to facilitate model training.

## 4. Modeling
Various regression models were considered to predict insurance charges:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor**

Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

## 5. Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on their predictive accuracy. The Random Forest Regressor provided the best performance, with the lowest MAE and MSE. The final model was chosen based on its ability to generalize well to unseen data, which was validated using cross-validation techniques.

## 6. Deployment
The insights gained from the analysis can be utilized by insurance companies to improve pricing models and customer targeting. The model can be deployed in a production environment to predict charges for new customers, enhancing the decision-making process.

## 7. Conclusion
This analysis highlighted key factors influencing insurance charges and provided a robust predictive model. Future work could involve deeper analysis of regional differences or the impact of additional features.
